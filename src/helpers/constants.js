    storyLong: "Due to the ongoing pandemic, the NBA season have been interrupted and social gatherings restricted which meant no basketball for months. Seeing as current basketball games on the market are expensive and also take time to develop, we wanted to create a simple, but fun interactive basketball related game that could be played with a friend. The inspiration for the game came from the childhood favourite card game WAR.",
